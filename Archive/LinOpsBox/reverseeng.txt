Gorgas Reverse Engineering (GRE)
XX Sep 2025
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: DEVOPS

Objective: Intel has identified that the Donovian_Webserver (192.168.28.111) is hosting binaries via port 80 at the following URI /longTermStorage. We have been tasked with pulling the binaries back into blue space to conduct Reverse Enineering operations. Conduct Reverse Engineering (disassemble, debug) on collected files, determine functionality and methods to successfully execute files.

Tools/Techniques: Ghidra, IDA, and GDB.

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = R3V3R535t@rt0F@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals:All files can be extracted from the known target "Donovian-Webserver". Only authorized to conduct task on Analyst Workstations.
